2.3.8 .WP Disks of polycarbonate plastic from a supplier are
analyzed for scratch and shock resistance. The results from
100 disks are summarized as follows:

Shock Resistance
High Low

Scratch
Resistance

High 70 9
Low 16 5

Let A denote the event that a disk has high shock resistance,

and let B denote the event that a disk has high scratch resistance. If a disk is selected at random, determine the following

probabilities:
a. P(A) 
b. P(B) 
c. P(A′)
d. P(A ∩ B) 
e. P(A ∪ B) 
f. P(A′ ∪ B)




2.4.6 .WP Strands of copper wire from a manufacturer are ana-
lyzed for strength and conductivity. The results from 100 strands

are as follows:

Strength
High Low
High conductivity 74 8
Low conductivity 15 3
a. If a strand is randomly selected, what is the probability
that its conductivity is high and its strength is high?
b. If a strand is randomly selected, what is the probability
that its conductivity is low or its strength is low?
c. Consider the event that a strand has low conductivity and
the event that the strand has low strength. Are these two
events mutually exclusive?
