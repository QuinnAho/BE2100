4.5.4 .WP Assume that X is normally distributed with a mean of
10 and a standard deviation of 2. Determine the value for x that
solves each of the following:
a. P(X > x) = 0.5 
b. P(X > x) = 0.95
c. P(x < X < 10) = 0 
d. P(−x < X − 10 < x) = 0.95
e. P(−x < X − 10 < x) = 0.99



4.5.8 Cholesterol is a fatty substance that is an important part
of the outer lining (membrane) of cells in the body of animals.
Its normal range for an adult is 120–240 mg/dl. The Food and

Nutrition Institute of the Philippines found that the total choles-
terol level for Filipino adults has a mean of 159.2 mg/dl and

84.1% of adults have a cholesterol level less than 200 mg/dl
(www.fnri.dost.gov.ph/). Suppose that the total cholesterol level
is normally distributed.
a. Determine the standard deviation of this distribution.
b. What are the quartiles (the 25% and 75% percentiles) of
this distribution?
c. What is the value of the cholesterol level that exceeds 90%
of the population?
d. An adult is at moderate risk if cholesterol level is more
than 1 but less than 2 standard deviations above the mean.

What percentage of the population is at moderate risk accord-
ing to this criterion?

e. An adult whose cholesterol level is more than 2 standard
deviations above the mean is thought to be at high risk. What
percentage of the population is at high risk?
f. An adult whose cholesterol level is less than 1 standard
deviation below the mean is thought to be at low risk. What
percentage of the population is at low risk?



4.5.9 In an accelerator center, an experiment needs a 1.41-cm-
thick aluminum cylinder (http://puhep1.princeton.edu/mumu/

target/Solenoid_Coil.pdf). Suppose that the thickness of a cylin-
der has a normal distribution with a mean of 1.41 cm and a

standard deviation of 0.01 cm.
a. What is the probability that a thickness is greater than
1.42 cm?
b. What thickness is exceeded by 95% of the samples?
c. If the specifications require that the thickness is between
1.39 cm and 1.43 cm, what proportion of the samples meets
specifications?
