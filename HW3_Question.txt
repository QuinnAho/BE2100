3.5.8 A multiple-choice test contains 25 questions, each with four
answers. Assume that a student just guesses on each question.
a. What is the probability that the student answers more than
20 questions correctly?
b. What is the probability that the student answers fewer
than 5 questions correctly?


3.8.6 The number of cracks in a section of interstate highway that
are significant enough to require repair is assumed to follow a
Poisson distribution with a mean of two cracks per mile.
a. What is the probability that there are no cracks that
require repair in 5 miles of highway?
b. What is the probability that at least one crack requires
repair in 1/2 mile of highway?
c. If the number of cracks is related to the vehicle load on the
highway and some sections of the highway have a heavy load
of vehicles whereas other sections carry a light load, what do
you think about the assumption of a Poisson distribution for
the number of cracks that require repair?
